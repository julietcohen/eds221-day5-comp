```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(here)
source(here("src", "cork_oak_growth.R"))
```

```{r}
height_t2(height_t1 = 25, t1 = 4, t2 = 10)
height_t2()

#can also write in line r code that flows with sentences in the r markdwon when you knit
```



the height of this cork at age 12 is `r height_t2(height_t1 = 10, t1 = 6, t2 = 8)` ft
